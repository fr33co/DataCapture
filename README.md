# DataCapture

A class used to accepts numbers and returns an object for querying
statistics about the inputs. Specifically, the returned object supports
querying how many numbers in the collection are less than a value, greater
than a value, or within a range.

The methods add(), less(), greater(), and between() should have
constant time O(1)

This test it's separated into 4 files: main program, functional tests,
unit tests and code complexity tests. Follow the instructions:

## Main program

You need to run:

```
$ python3 main.py   
```

## Functional tests

An integer number is requested to generate the list and its data. 

You need to run:

```
$ python3 main_functional.py  
```

## Unit tests

You need to run:

```
$ python3 main_functional_test.py  
```

## Code complexity tests

You need to run:

```
$ python3 main_complexity_test.py  
```
